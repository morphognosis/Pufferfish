Pufferfish nest building with Morphognosis learning and control.

A species of pufferfish builds circular nesting sites on the sea floor.
This project simulates this nest-building behavior in a cellular automaton using the Morphognosis model.

Setup:

1. Unzip the pufferfish.zip file.
2. Import Eclipse project.
3. Run .sh or .bat commands in the work directory
